# Project Title: DevJunior Among Us
Welcome to DevJunior Impostor, an engaging and challenging game that tests your team's software development skills and detective abilities.

## Game Overview
In DevJunior Impostor, your team's mission is to build a simple application, such as a to-do list app. However, there's a twist: among your team is an impostor, the "DevJunior", who is selected randomly at the start of the game.

The DevJunior's role is to subtly sabotage the project. They might introduce bugs, commit poorly written code, or employ bad development practices, all in an attempt to slow down the team's progress.

## Objectives
The rest of the team, composed of experienced developers, must identify and eliminate (vote out) the DevJunior while continuing to build the application. The team wins if they successfully identify the DevJunior or if they complete the to-do list app before time runs out.

### Game Mechanics
The progress of the to-do list app is monitored through acceptance tests. These tests ensure that the application meets the necessary requirements and functions as expected.

### Winning the Game
The game ends in one of two ways:

The team completes the to-do list app before time runs out, passing all acceptance tests.
The team correctly identifies and votes out the DevJunior.

*In DevJunior Impostor, not only will you hone your coding skills, but you'll also develop your ability to spot bad coding practices and work effectively as a team. Are you ready to take on the challenge?*
